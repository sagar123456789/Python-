#code to find the closest point to origin at a given direction(angle in degree)
#Sample inputs for code

Enter Points for Origin 0
Enter Points for Origin 0
Origin is : [0, 0]
Enter direction :30
Enter number Line Segments:3
Enter Points for line 1
Enter Points for line 2
Enter Points for line 3
Enter Points for line 2
Line is excluded as it is not intersecting the angle

Line is excluded as it is not intersecting the angle
Enter Points for line 5
Enter Points for line 6
Enter Points for line 7
Enter Points for line 2
All segment [[[1, 2], [3, 2]], [[1, 6], [6, 5]], [[5, 6], [7, 2]]]
All dist [[100000000], [100000000], [0.1860042339640731]]
the Closest line segment to  [0, 0] is [[5, 6], [7, 2]]
